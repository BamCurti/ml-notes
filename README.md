# Machine Learning Notes
The purpose of this repository is to contain all my projects and laboratories from my class of machines learning. Every project will contain a jupyter notebook and a .txt file with the link to te source of the dataset.

## Considerations
* In the case the data is too big, it will be necessary to save the image set in a folder called `data` in the respective project directory.

## Projects
### 3. Bouquet Flower Classification
*Data extracted from [Hackaton Blossom (Flower Classification)](https://www.kaggle.com/spaics/hackathon-blossom-flower-classification?select=flower_data)*.
The purpose of this project is to train multiple classifier models to recognize different flowers.

#### Before running the notebook
1. Unzip the image set in a folder call `data`.
2. Run the Orange script. In the case where it does not run properly, it will be required to install the widget __Image Analytics__. It will saved two datasets in the `data` folder, called train.csv and test.csv.
